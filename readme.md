# WordPress PHP Upgrade Program

With this plugin we want to try to get a better insigh about what PHP version people are running their WordPress installations on.

By having a completely Opt-IN approach we make sure all privacy is maintained.

The following data is sent to the collection service:
 * PHP Version
 * Unique installation identifier

We have to provide a unique installation identifier to avoid double entries for the same website.
The identifier is completely anonymous and can not be traced back to the specific website.

Please help to have this plugin installed in as many WordPress installation as possible.
The more information we have about the actual PHP version usage, the better we can something about it!

## You have an older PHP installation?

We would be very grateful if you would contact your hosting provider (the company you pay to have a website) and tell them you need an upgrade.
If they cannot provide this for you, find somebody who can transfer your website to a hosting provider that keeps it's services up-to-date.
